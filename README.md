# Partitioning Algorithms:

> This repository contains implementations of various partitioning algorithms.
> The algorithms are implemented by the *Operating System* in order to find out the holes in the linked list and allocate them to the processes.

### Algorithms:
1. First-Fit
2. Best-Fit 
3. Worst-Fit
4. Next-Fit
5. Quick-Fit

### How to use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Go to the directory of the algorithm you want to use.
3. Run the `Program.cs` file using `dotnet run` command.
4. See for yourself how the algorithm allocates the processes to the holes.

`Future updates will include more algorithms and a GUI.`


`Ps: I am re-Learning C# so the code might not be the best.`
